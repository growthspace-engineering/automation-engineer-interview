## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (Version 20.x or later)

This project is compatible across different operating systems. Administrator rights might be required for certain npm installations.

## Getting Started

Test an Arcade Game Playlist application: https://arcade.kibibit.duckdns.org/

This application displays a list of games and includes a few by default.

## Application Main Sections

|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Show all games in the collection   | Main screen displaying all games.    |                                        |
| Enter edit mode                    | Allows adding or deleting games.     | <img src="screenshots/edit-mode.png" width="250" alt="Edit Mode"> |
| **[Edit Mode]** Add new game       | Adds a new game to the collection.   | <img src="screenshots/add-game-btn.png" width="250" alt="Add Game Button"> |

| **(BONUS)** [Attract Mode](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attract_mode)     | Screen saver that shows games in a roulette, switching every few minutes. It should spin the game list and stop on a game for 1-2 minutes, showing that game's details, and then spin again | <img src="screenshots/attract-mode-btn.png" width="250" alt="Attract Mode Button"> |

## Backend API for Prep & Teardown

Works with a backend application. Swagger documentation: https://arcade.kibibit.duckdns.org/api/docs

## Assignment Goals (ðŸ•’ 3-4 hours):

- Implement critical test cases for application features:
    - Edit Mode
    - Adding a game
    - Deleting a game
    - Main View (View All Collection Games)
    - Game Details Modal
- Include prep and teardown for each test, preferably using API calls, to manage test data.
- Aim for minimal code duplication and a scalable architecture.
- Clean, readable code

## Bonus Goals (ðŸ•’ 1-1.5 hours):

- Integrate at least one advanced Playwright feature (e.g., visual testing, lighthouse, testing multiple screen sizes). Create at least two tests using this feature.
- Write tests for the Attract Mode screensaver.
